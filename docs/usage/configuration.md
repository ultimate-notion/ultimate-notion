# Ultimate Notion configuration

Ultimate Notion looks up the environment variable `ULTIMATE_NOTION_CONFIG` for a configuration [TOML]-file.
If this variable is not set, it defaults to `~/.ultimate-notion/config.toml` under MacOS/Linux and
`$HOME/.ultimate-notion/config.toml` under Windows systems. If no configuration file is found, a default one is created
automatically that will set the Notion token to be looked up using the environment variable `NOTION_TOKEN`.
Alternatively, you can set your token directly in the configuration file.

The default configuration file looks like:

```toml
[ultimate_notion]
sync_state_dir = "sync_states"
debug = "${env:ULTIMATE_NOTION_DEBUG|false}"
token = "${env:NOTION_TOKEN}"

[google]
client_secret_json = "client_secret.json"
token_json = "token.json"
```

The most important key is `token` within the `ultimate_notion` section, where you need to either enter the
*Internal Integration Token* or set it instead in the referenced environment variable, i.e. `NOTION_TOKEN`,
to avoid storing your token in a file. Setting `debug` to `true` will generate tons of debug information,
which is helpful if you want to report an [issue]. The key `sync_state_dir` as well as the whole `google`
section is only important if you want to sync an Ultimate Notion database with Google Tasks.
All provided non-absolute paths are always relative to the directory of configuration file, e.g. `token.json`
will reside in the same directory as `config.toml`.

Note that the value `${env:ENV_VARIABLE|default}` allows you to specify that Ultimate Notion should first
try to look up the environment variable `ENV_VARIABLE` and if not found use the `default` value. The default
part can be omitted so that reading the configuration fails if an expected environment variable is not
properly set.
