# Creating and modifying pages

## Creating a new page

To create a new page, we first create a session and retrieve a root page, which
will then hold our new page:

```python
import ultimate_notion as uno

ROOT_PAGE = 'Tests'  # page with connected Ultimate Notion integration
notion = uno.Session.get_or_create()

root_page = notion.search_page(ROOT_PAGE).item()
```

Using `root_page` we can simply create a new page with:

```python
my_page = notion.create_page(parent=root_page, title='Autogenerated page')
```

Our new page is empty and we can check that with:

```python
assert not my_page.children
# or
assert len(my_page.children) == 0
```

## Adding content to a page

Our new page can now be populated with the typical [Notion blocks] from the [blocks module].
Let's create a heading 1 block and append it to our page with:

```python
h1 = uno.Heading1('My new page')
my_page.append(h1)
```

We can also append several blocks at once:

```python
my_page.append([
    uno.Paragraph('Some text...'),
    uno.Code(
        'SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE',
        language=uno.CodeLang.SQL,
        caption='SQL Query'
        ),
    uno.Quote(
        '"You know, for a mathematician, he did not have enough imagination. '
        'But he has become a poet and now he is fine." - D. Hilbert',
        color=uno.Color.BLUE
        ),
    uno.Callout('Ultimate Notion rocks!', color=uno.BGColor.PURPLE, icon=uno.Emoji('ðŸš€')),
    uno.Heading2('Showing off some more...'),
    uno.BulletedItem('First bulleted item'),
    uno.BulletedItem('Second bulleted item'),
    uno.NumberedItem('First numbered item', color=uno.Color.RED),
    uno.NumberedItem('Second numbered item', color=uno.Color.RED),
    uno.ToDoItem('First checked Todo', checked=True),
    uno.ToDoItem('Second open Todo'),
    uno.ToggleItem('Toggle item'),
    uno.Divider(),
    uno.Heading3('Some more fancy stuff...'),
    uno.TableOfContents(color=uno.Color.PINK),
    uno.Breadcrumb(),
    uno.Embed('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ', caption='Rick'),
    uno.Bookmark('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'),
    uno.Equation(r'-1 = \exp(i \pi)'),
    ]
)
```

Let's say we have forgotten one block and want to add it at a specific position, i.e. `after` another block:

```python
new_paragraph = uno.Paragraph('Some more text, which was added afterwards...')
my_page.append(new_paragraph, after=my_page.children[2])
```

As the block reference `new_paragraph` is automatically updated when appended to the page, we can also use it now
as a reference to append a new block after it, e.g.:

```python
another_paragraph = uno.Paragraph('Another paragraph...')
my_page.append(another_paragraph, after=new_paragraph)
```

Another possibility to insert a block after a certain other block is to use the `insert_after` method of a block itself.
Let's say we want to add a divider after the block `another_paragraph`:

```python
another_paragraph.insert_after(uno.Divider())
```

To delete a block from a page, we can just call `.delete()` on it:

```python
another_paragraph.delete()
```

In some cases, you might rather want to replace a block with another block.
For this we can use the `.replace` method of a block.

```python
first_block = my_page.children[0]
first_block.replace(uno.Heading1('Heading of my new page!'))
```

Also note that you can even pass a sequence of new blocks to `.insert_after` and `.replace`.

!!! tip

    Python's *walrus* operator, i.e. `:=`, can be extremely useful when working with blocks that you want to reference
    later on. So instead of assigning new blocks to variables and passing them to `page.append(...)`, you could just write:

    ```python
    page = notion.create_page(parent=root_page, title='Another autogenerated page')
    page.append([
        heading1 := uno.Heading1('My heading'),
        paragraph := uno.Paragraph('My paragraph')
    ])
    print(paragraph.block_url)
    ```

!!! note

    For type hinting, use [AnyBlock] for a general block, e.g.

    ```python
    new_blocks: uno.AnyBlock = [uno.Heading1('New section'), uno.Divider(), uno.Paragraph('My paragraph')]
    ```

## Modifying blocks

Most properties of a block also provide setter, so you can just assign a new value to the property to modify it.
Let's assume, we first have to retrieve the page we created above and want to modify the first heading:

```python
my_page = notion.get_page(my_page.id)  # or `notion.search_page(...).item()` in practice

heading = my_page.children[0]
assert heading.color == uno.Color.DEFAULT
heading.color = uno.BGColor.RED
heading.rich_text = 'Red heading of my new page!'
```

Check the [blocks module] to see which properties can also be set. Ultimate Notion allows updating all properties that could
also be udpated via the [update-a-block endpoint] of the official Notion API.

Our page now looks like this so far:

![Block page](../assets/images/notion-block-page.png){: style="width:600px; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"}

!!! bug

    Sometimes setting certain attributes, for instance the `color` property with a foreground color, i.e. `uno.Color`, can
    result in the default black text although the property is set correctly when checked in the Notion app. This seems
    to be a bug within the Notion backend itself.

## Nested blocks

A really useful feature of Notion blocks is that most of them can be nested
Therefore some blocks, like paragaphs, quotes, toggable headings and so on, can have `children`
and thus also have an `append` method, just like a page.

Let's create a new page where we store various file types under a toggable Headning:

```python
file_page = notion.create_page(parent=root_page, title='Page with nested blocks')

heading = uno.Heading1('My files', toggleable=True)
file_page.append(heading)

heading.append([
    uno.File(
        'robots.txt',
        'https://www.google.de/robots.txt',
        caption='Google Robots'
        ),
    uno.Image(
        'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/08/06/09/16/flowers-4387827_1280.jpg',
        caption='Path on meadow'
        ),
    uno.Video(
        'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ',
        caption='Rick Roll'
        ),
    uno.PDF(
        'https://www.iktz-hd.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dummy.pdf',
        caption='Dummy PDF'
        ),
])
```

!!! info

    We can only add children blocks to a block that is already *in notion*, i.e. was already
    appended to a page. You can also programmatically check that with the [in_notion] property
    of a block.

## Columns & tables

Assume that we want to structure our page a bit more using columns. We define a set of columns
using the [Columns] block. This block now behaves like a list of where each element presents a column.
We can now just append to a column, e.g.:

```python
page = notion.create_page(parent=root_page, title='Page with advanced blocks')

cols = uno.Columns(2)
page.append(cols)

cols[0].append(uno.Paragraph('Column 1'))
cols[1].append(uno.Paragraph('Column 2'))
```

Using the some concept, we can also create a table but this time we specify the cells instead of columns.
Creating a 4x6 table with 4 rows and 6 columns where the first row is a header row and thus we set
`header_row` to true. We can use indexing to assign either whole rows or specific cells:

```python
table = uno.Table(4, 3, header_row=True, header_col=False)
table[0] = ('First name', 'Last name', 'Sports')
table[1, 0] = 'Florian'
table[1, 1] = 'Wilhelm'
table[1, 2] = 'Running and bicycling'

page.append(table)
```

!!! note

    All cells of a table are initialized with an empty string. Therefore, to delete the content of a cell,
    you need to assign an empty string, i.e. `''`. For instance, to delete the first row after the header:

    ```python
    table[1] = ('', '', '')
    ```

To access the all rows, i.e. children of the table, we can use `children`:

```python
rows = table.children
assert isinstance(rows[0], uno.TableRow)
assert isinstance(rows[0], tuple)
```

In order to access a single row or even a cell, we can use indexing like:

```python
row = table[0]
cell = table[0, 0]
assert cell == 'First name'
```

When using only a row index, a `TableRow` object will be returned that is a subclass of `tuple` with special
functionality. For instance, to delete a row from a table you can call `delete`, e.g.:

```python
row.delete()
```

Tables can be easily modified in various other ways using the `insert_row`, `append_row` methods as well as assigning
to the `has_header_col` and `has_header_row` properties.

## Advanced blocks

There are some additional more advanced blocks like link to a page and synced block. Let's take a look at those.

Assume we have our "Getting Started"-page and want to link to it from the page, we just created above.

```python
target_page = notion.search_page('Getting Started').item()

page.append(uno.LinkToPage(target_page))
```

A synced block is a different kind of beast. We first have to define an *original* block, which acts
as a container for other blocks that should be synced. Then we append various blocks to it and finally
create a *synced* block, which will be synchronized with the content of the original block.

```python
orig_block = uno.SyncedBlock(uno.Paragraph('This is a synced paragraph'))
page.append(orig_block)

sync_block = orig_block.create_synced()
page.append(sync_block)
```

Now we have two paragraphs, with the second always reflecting the content of the first.

## Working with texts

So far we passed to most blocks basic strings and only provided in some cases a colour for the
whole block. Notion allows much fancier formatting for texts, i.e. rich texts, but also
inline formulas and mentions of various types.
All this is supported via the [Text] type, which is a subclass of the ordinary `str` type.
For your convience three different constructor functions, i.e. [text], [math] and [mention],
are provided that construct a [Text] object.
An example illustrates this:

```python
page = notion.create_page(parent=root_page, title='Page with fancy text')

rt = uno.text('This is a ') + uno.text('bold', bold=True) + uno.text(' word.\n')
assert isinstance(rt, uno.Text)

rt += 'We can even add a normal string to it.\n'
rt += uno.text('Now some ') + uno.text('inline formula: ', color=uno.Color.RED)
rt += uno.math(r'-1 = e^{i \pi}') + '\n'
rt += uno.join([
    uno.text('All', italic=True),
    uno.text('possible', underline=True),
    uno.text('formatting, ', color=uno.BGColor.PURPLE),
    uno.text('is', code=True),
    uno.text('it?', strikethrough=True),
    uno.text('it not?', italic=True, bold=True)
    ])

page.append(uno.Paragraph(rt))
```

To achieve fancy formatting, we have to mix and match [Text] objects generated by [text], [mention] and [math]
to compose the formatting we want.

!!! warning

    Be cautious with the operator precedence of `+=` and `+` in the example above.
    While `rt += 'We can even add a normal string to it.\n'` works since `rt` is of type `Text`,
    which supports this, `rt += 'We can even add a normal string to ' +  uno.text('it.\n')`
    would not work as we would first conatenate a `str` with a `Text` before we append it to a `Text`.
    A `str` object would ignore the additional formatting information in the `Text` object while concatenating.

Let's see how we can mention a person, page, database or even a date.

```python
from datetime import datetime

person = notion.search_user('Florian Wilhelm').item()
dummy_db = notion.create_db(parent=root_page)
dummy_db.title = 'Dummy DB'
intro_page = notion.search_page('Getting Started').item()
my_date = datetime(1592, 3, 14) # or better use the pendulum library

rt = uno.join([
    uno.mention(person),
    uno.mention(dummy_db),
    uno.mention(intro_page),
    uno.mention(my_date)
    ], delim=' : ')
page.append(uno.Paragraph(rt))
```

Let's take a look how our fancy text page looks like in the end.
