Ultimate Notion is the ultimate Python client for [Notion]! It allows you to access, create and change your
Notion databases and pages in the most convenient and pythonic way. Under [Features](features.md) you will find
the current status of the implemented functionality. Ultimate Notion is distributed under the terms of the [MIT] license.

## Navigation

Documentation for specific `MAJOR.MINOR` versions can be chosen by using the dropdown on the top of every page.
The `dev` version reflects changes that have not yet been released. Shortcuts can be used for navigation, i.e.
<kbd>,</kbd>/<kbd>p</kbd> and <kbd>.</kbd>/<kbd>n</kbd> for previous and next page, respectively, as well as
<kbd>/</kbd>/<kbd>s</kbd> for searching.
